# RESEARCH & PROJECT EXPERIENCE

#### **SJTU-[ThinkLab](http://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/)**

Member *Nov 2020 - Feb 2020*

- Researching topics related to **Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning** (Mainly used: `raylib`, `pytorch`).

- Applied for a patent about applying CNN-based MARL algorithms on optimizing cooperation between drones for scouting unexplored areas.

#### **Service Migration Strategy on Edge Cloud Computing**

Member *with Xudong Wang, professor, UM-SJTU Joint institute, Jan 2020 - Present*
- Applying machine learning algorithm to determine the edge server for the backend to
migrate based on the current B5G network status and computational resources, so as to
guarantee QoS of applications


#### **Experimental Evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms** 

Adaptive Autonomous Agent Lab Researcher  *Aug 2019 - Sep 2020* 

- Tested the **efficiency** of searching **optimized hyperparameters** of Augmented Random Search (ARS) algorithm based on Roboschool environment.

- Evaluated **hyperparameter optimization** techniques in deep Reinforcement Learning (among grid, random and Bayesian search).

- Tested the codes on three different systems of server: **SLURM, PBS, and OAR**; Skilled in remote environment setting and online code testing.

#### **Application of Drone Delivery in Logistics of Medicine**

 Leader of product design  *Feb 2020 - Present* 

- Designed algorithms for order assignment; used Floyd algorithm to calculate the shortest path; took quantity, quality and distance as factors to get each weight to design optimized path for delivering.

- Used Nginx to perform load balancing for orders from the central system to individual base stations and drones.
